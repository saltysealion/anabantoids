Awesome. The hendra fry are free swimming! It's week zero and there are a good number of fry swimming around. I'm currently feeding them microworms as I watch them group around the surface of the tank. I am definitely in need of some baby brine shrimp but for now the worms will have to do. The tank seems to be swarming with life, looking close at the rocks or aroudn the leaves, I can see little critters move around. I have no idea what these life forms are but I am sure they will make good snacks for the fry. So far the parents are being good and leaving the fry alone, actually the male is busy with his next spawn! That is a back to back spawn for my hendra. I wish I was as successful with my other bettas as I am with the hendra sp.

Picked up some additional plants this weekend. I picked up a bunch of Mayaca Fluviatilis and _. Again, trying to jam more plants into my tanks to get them nice and lush. I am contemplating on adding Co2 to the tanks to help plant growths. I think that it will also assist in lowering pH. I also think that adding Co2 will not have negative effects on the fish because they are anabantoids and that this reflects their natural habitats, that is a pool of water with little dissolved oxygen. That's a lot of thining, I'm just hesitating here because I do not want my fish to die from this. My current plan is to produce Co2 from a yiest mixture and allow the bubbles to freely float up so that I can start with low dose and go from there.

I have noticed that some of my wilds have grown since I purchased them and that they are actually quite stocky. What used to be a nice slender fish has become this fat sassuage with fins. I think I'm over feeding my fish and that in their natural homes, food would be a little more scarse than it is in their current tanks. I am cutting down on feeding, I think 3 feeds a week is enough for these fish. 

Overall, fish are eating and pooping as per usual and there is no other breeding activity to report on.
