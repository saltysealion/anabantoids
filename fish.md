The fighting fish genus Betta comprises more than 65 species distributed in South-East Asia. Of these 65, I own 6 different species!

## Betta hendra spec.

My favorite species in coccina complex. Most fish within this complex come in wine red colouration but this particular fish sports iridescent green/blue scales clearly separating it from the others.
