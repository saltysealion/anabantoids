I have always kept fish and kept many Betta Splendens in the past. However this year, I have decided to try keeping the wild variants. When I first saw these fish, I did not think much of them, actually they are quite dull and unattractive at first. Over time I have warmed up towards them and found them to be very beautiful and rewarding.
