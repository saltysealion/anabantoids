I did a quick ammonia test last night on the macrostoma tank. The results are perfect, the API test kit reported 0ppm. The PH in the tank is still in the 7.x range. I assume that the biological bacteria is still alive and functioning well resulting in the good reading. I am interested in watching the tank mature with the PH swinging towards 4. At this point I suspect that the bacteria would be dead and I would totally be relying on plants to absorb the ammonia, nitrogen.
