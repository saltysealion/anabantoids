The fighting fish genus Betta comprises more than 65 species distributed in South-East Asia. Of these, I have kept/keep 6 different species!

## Betta albimarginata

A great little mouth brooder with a white rimmed fins. I have had this pair spawn once and the male successfully spit 15 fry. However, the male hunted down his own and the Female has passed away so I am unable to continue with this species.

My favorite species in coccina complex. Most fish within this complex come in wine red colouration but this particular fish sports iridescent green/blue scales clearly separating it from the others.
