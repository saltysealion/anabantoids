I did a quick ammonia test last night on the macrostoma tank. The results are perfect, the API test kit reported 0ppm. The PH in the tank is still in the 7.x range. I assume that the biological bacteria is still alive and functioning well resulting in the good reading. I am interested in watching the tank mature with the PH swinging towards 4. At this point I suspect that the bacteria would be dead and I would totally be relying on plants to absorb the ammonia, nitrogen.

Overall, all fish are doing great. I'm particularly please with the burdigala tank. So far, these guys have not settled in their tank. They are often hidding and when seen, the pair are not displaying their vibrant colours they are known for. When they were first introduced, they were in a scaped tank full of plants and wood, they did not do well in this setup. In my fustration, I removed everything but the sponge filter to encourage them to come out. This did not go so well, they spent most of their time hidding behind the filter. With the reintroduction of the plants, they seem to be much happier.
