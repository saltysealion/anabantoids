        <title>Blood in, blood out</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lets start with the sad news, my female Betta albimarginata has died. She has
not been well over the past few days so I separated her from her male. She
continued to feed well on black worms but had a swimming disorder. Last night,
instead of floating she sunk and looked extremly lifeless. This morning she was
found dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fustrating knowing that this is the last wild female I can get my hands on
given the new laws in Australia that prevent further importation of this fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onto the good news. This morning, I discovered that the hendra eggs have
hatched! The male hendra is doing a great job of looking after his nest. I can
see the film canister float up more towards the back as the number of bubbles
hes squeezing in increases. He’s also doing a good job at guarding his nest,
chasing the female away when she approaches. I am looking forwards to seeing the
little critters become free swimmers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plants plants plants. I am trying to jam more and more plants into the aquariums
Apart from my fondness of plants, I am also relying on them to absorb the
neutirnets floating around before they reach harmful levels. So far I am relying
on duck weed to do the exporting of neutirents but I have more Bucephalandra to add to the tanks. I am thinking that the Bucephalandra would do
good with shaded light from the duck weed. I just hope that they can with stand
the low PH. So far I am seeing good growth on my existing Bucephalandra, time
will tell how this goes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ca Da, a blog about keeping Wild Bettas</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have always kept fish and kept many Betta Splendens in the past. However this year, I have decided to try keeping the wild variants. When I first saw these fish, I did not think much of them, actually they are quite dull and unattractive at first. Over time I have warmed up towards them and found them to be very beautiful and rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;
