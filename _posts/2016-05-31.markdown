I previously removed the film can from my hendra tank to give them a break. They had a little break but the male didn't hessitate to make a nest among the duck weed. A day or so after, I found eggs in the nest and today, the eggs have hatched. Initially the nest was in the front corner, but later he relocated the nest and his children to the back corner! What an amazing fish.

Things in the other tanks are doing well. Burdigala are just starting to come out but their colours are still very faded. I want to add more tannins into their tank to encourage them to relax more.

The macs are doing well and eating like pigs as usual. The pH in the tank is currently 7.5. Still too high, even with the addition of mopani drift wood.

Sp Kalaputa have surprised me. Their colours continue to develop and so is their colour in their eyes. No longer innocent looking pigs warriors, they now remind me of aggressive cichlids. I'll try to grab a photo of them.
